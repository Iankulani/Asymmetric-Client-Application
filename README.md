# Asymmetric-Client-Application
A simple asymmetric server. This project demonstrates an asymmetric server-client architecture where the server plays a more complex role in handling communications, encryption, and processing, while the client is responsible for sending requests and displaying results. The server utilizes asymmetric encryption (public/private key pairs) to ensure secure data transmission between the client and the server. 

How to install
